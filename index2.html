<p class="p1"> The agriculture sector in the UAE has undergone many changes. The challenge is to conduct agriculture with minimum water. Modern irrigation systems and hydroponics are being increasingly engaged. Farmers are switching to organic farming. &nbsp; </p>
	<h5> <p class="p2"> Agriculture is an old activity in the United Arab Emirates practised in Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, Al Ain and in some oases, such as the Liwa oasis.The sector developed rapidly since 1971, despite problems due to the scarcity of water resources and arable land, soil salinity, difficult environmental conditions, high production costs, agricultural pests and post-harvest losses. Agriculture has become an economic activity that relies on the use of the latest technologies. The late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan played a significant role in the evolution and development of the agriculture sector in the country. Huge efforts were made to preserve water resources, with emphasis on promoting the adoption and installation of modern irrigation systems to replace flood irrigation method, which wastes large amounts of water. The use of modern irrigation systems (sprinkler, drip and fountain irrigation systems) rose to 91 per cent in 2011 from 32 per cent in 1999. The number of farms increased from 4,000 in 1971 to 35,704 in 2011, with an area of 105,257 hectares. As a result of the UAE's efforts, there are now 54 organic vegetation farms, three animal production farms and one manufacturing facility. The organic production area in the UAE increased to 3920 hectares by the end of 2013. Through sustainable agriculture, the UAE aims to ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems. &nbsp;</p>

United Arab Emirates - Agricultural land (% of land area) - actual values, historical data, forecasts and projections were sourced from the World Bank on October of 2020. </p>
