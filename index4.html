	<h2>Growing Plants And Soil Development In The UAE&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;Nearly all citrus trees will do well here. They like the heat and will tolerate humidity. Try orange, grapefruit, lemon, mandarin and limes. They will need to be nurtured through the summer, so keep them watered but don’t over water or you will cause rot. Avoid putting irrigation too close to the stem. Citrus is often grafted on to the existing root stock of other citrus-fruit species, so check that the graft union is well established and strong when selecting your plants. Prune away any shoots from below the graft as continuing maintenance to discourage the plant from reverting to its original stock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Bananas also give a lush and tropical feel and can flower and bear fruit within 18 months of their first shoot from root stock. Trees need protection from hot summer winds, which may cause them to break, but they do tolerate heat and humidity well if given plenty of water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Most grape vines will also grow here, but are very susceptible to humidity and mildew, and coming out of summer will most likely need to be treated with a fungicide. They like to be trained and tend to thrive more in a clay soil. They will grow quite well in heavy soils – digging clay through your soil will help stop water draining away too quickly. Grapes really benefit from a heavy pruning after fruiting to encourage next season’s growth.</p>
